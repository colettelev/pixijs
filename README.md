# Phaser and PixiJS learning page

[editor on GitHub](https://github.com/colettelev/pixijs/edit/master/README.md) 

This page is to show what I have learned with Phaser 3 and Pixi.js

## Phaser 3

I took some concepts of Phaser and created a tiny game.

Concepts learned:
- how to add a sprite to a page
- sprite positioning (placed platforms)
- physics: movement, bounce, jumping, gravity
- adding spritesheet for character running
